## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill
tool as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly, do NOT use other tools first.
The skill has specialized workflows that produce better results than ad-hoc answers.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke gstack-office-hours
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", 500 errors → invoke gstack-investigate
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke gstack-ship
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke gstack-qa
- Code review, check my diff → invoke gstack-review
- Update docs after shipping → invoke gstack-document-release
- Weekly retro → invoke gstack-retro
- Design system, brand → invoke gstack-design-consultation
- Visual audit, design polish → invoke gstack-design-review
- Architecture review → invoke gstack-plan-eng-review
